Berwick - deer on board to be entered at the nearest custom house
The master of the Berwick, as well as the boarding officer, were under the impression that the vessel was cruising under license, but a further examination revealed the fact that the Berwick is a registered vessel. Although the master violated Section of the Revised Statutes by attempting to import the reindeer (cattle) without entering them through a Custom House. The Commanding Officer, in view of the previously recorded facts, allowed him the privalege of landing the deer on the American side at any place other than Government Stations, with the understanding that they be put on the vessel's manifest and entered at the nearest custom house as soon as practicable.

Am Sch Berwick, Capt. Wagner, having on board 14 reindeer from the Siberian side, was found to be cruising under license instead of register. From an interview with Capt. Wagner, the Comd'g Officer found that the master of the Berwick had acted under the direction of Mr. Bruce, late Superintendent of the Reindeer Station, who represented to him that he had power to grant him the privilege of importing the deer. As everything tended to show that there was no intention on the part of the master of the Berwick to violate the law, the Comd'g Officer permitted him to return the deer to the other side, thinking that the trouble, loss of time, and expense to which the Berwick would be put, would sufficiently vindicate the law, until a report to the Department could be made.
Received 6 boxes of bread and one barrel of molasses from Reindeer Station for trading purposes.
