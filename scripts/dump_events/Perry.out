This day's watch was stood by Lieut JV Wild up to about 8:20 pm when according to best information, he left the vessel in uniform informing quartermaster that he was going up to the office (Moran Brothers) and that he would be back in a few minutes.  Quartermaster Mellick inferred that he was going to telephone.  He did not return at all, and after going off watch at midnight Quartermaster Mellick went to the office to enquire for Mr Wild.  Watchman said no officer had passed out the gate in uniform.  These facts were reported to me upon my arrival on board the morning of the 30th instant.
