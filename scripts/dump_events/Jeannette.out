Description of the Instruments used in making the Meteorological Observations recorded in the columns of the Log Book.  Barometer The standard was a Mercurial Barometer made by Adie, Landau, No. 1231, and was placed in the State-room of the Commanding Officer.  For convenience of observation a Holosteric Aneroid Barometer made by T.S. & J.D. Negus, New York (without numbers) was placed in the open air on the outside of the Cabin bulkhead and remained there from June 25th to 4.30 PM September 25th 1879. The entries in the Log Book between these dates are readings of this Baromoeter: and a general correction of one tenth of an inch (0.1") subtractive must be applied to these to make them agree with the Standard Mercurial at similar tempera tures.  At 4.30 PM September 25th - 1879, the said Aneroid was moved to within the Cabin, and set by comparison with Mercurial Standard to a reading reduced to a temperature of 32 degrees Fahrenheit.  At 2 PM September 27th - 1879 it was set to comparison with Mercurial Standard to a reading reduced to a tempera ture of 46 degrees Fahrenheit. The reading of this Aneroid was discontinued at midnight October 31st - 1879.  From 1 AM November 1st 1879 to Midnight January ~ 1880 the readings for the Log were made from Aneroid Barometer No. 28051 which had been set by comparison with Mercurial Standard to a reading reduced to 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

Description of the Instruments used in making the Meteorological Observations recorded in the columns of the Log Book.
Barometer   The Standard was a Mercurial Barometer made by Adie, London, No 1231, and was placed in the Cabin. The entries in the Log Book are from reading of Aneroid barometer N 28051 which had been set by comparison ~ Mercurial Standard to a reading reduced to 32 Fahrenheit and placed in the ~ ~ Room.
Temperature. The "Air Dry Bulb" was recorded from readings of Standard Mercurial Thermometer No 4313 made by Green, New York. So long as the temperature was above the freezing point of the Mercury of that instrument. At other times the temperature was recorded from reading ~ of spirit thermometers, uncolored or colored as marked "clear" or "purple" ~, and indicated by their numbers. All these thermometers were made by Green New York.
The "Water at Surface" was recorded from readings of a thermometer attached to a Hydrometer Cup made by G. ~, New York, (without number) and which thermometer agrees with Standard Mercurial Thermometer No 4313.

The Temperature at a depth of two fathoms was obtained ~ water drawn from one of the Sea ~ in the bottom ~ the ship which was quite uniformly 12 feet below ~ Surface of the water. The readings were made from ~ Thermometer attached to the Hydrometer Cup made by ~, New York before mentioned. 
Specific Gravities Water was brought up by a ~ Water Cup from ~ greatest depth obtained. Water at 2 fathoms was obtained ~ a Sea ~ as mentioned above. The "Surface"water was obtained from about one foot below the Surface. The Specific Gravities were read from a Hydrometer ~ ~, New York. Specific Gravity ~ Fahr. ~ 1.020 to 1.031, for the greatest depth. Surface water ~ water at 2 fathoms had their Specific Gravity recorded ~ readings of a more delicate Hydrometer marked "Reinmann ~, 96 Fulton St. N.Y. Specific Gravity ~ ~F Scale ~ to 1.040.

At 1.30am there was a loud noise as of the cracking of the ship's frame by great ice pressure. The noise was very loud in two places, abreast the mizen mast on the Starboard side and forward of the foremast. Examination of the ice surrounding the ship showed no movement to have occasioned it, and it was supposed by the Commanding Officer that the noise might have been caused by the drawing of some of the ship's fastenings on account of the intense cold.
At 7.45am the wind having shifted from NNW to West, the pack commenced to move with its usual grinding noise. The greatest pressure was on the line of an old break running across the ship's beam from W to E. The floe on the port side of the ship (to the Ed) was bulged up and broken in many places and the floe on the edge of the old break was piled up against the ship's stern, causing a great longitudinal pressure.
At 10.30am water was discovered in the fire room flowing from forward. An immediate examination showed two streams of water about 1 inch in diameter entering the fore peak through the solid filling placed in the bo~ at the Mare Island Navy Yard.

At 7.45 Am the wind having shifted from NNW to West, the pack commenced to move with the usual grinding noise. The greatest pressure was on the line of an old break running across the ships bow from W to E. The floe on the port side of the ship (to the E'd) was bulged up and broken in many places and the floe on the edge of the old break was piled up against the ships Stem, causing a great longitudinal pressure. At 10.30 AM water was discovered in the fire room flowing from forward. An immediate examination showed two streams of water about an inch in diameter entering the fore peak through the solid filling placed in the bows at the Mare Island Navy Yard. The forward deck pumps were immediately rigged and manned, and steam raised in the port boiler to work the steam pump. There was a depth of 18 inches of water in the fore peak, 24 inches of water in the Starb rooms next abaft it, and 36 inches in the forehold.  While one watch worked the bilge pump, the other watch broke out the fore peak, the floor room, and the forehold; being able to hold their own with the water by steady pumping. Difficulty was found in filling the boiler, the sea cocks being frozen fast; but it was done by pouring water from the bilge (then 15 inches deep) through the man hole plates in the top of the boiler. The temperature of the Engine room being  -25 Fah. a long time was required to get the pump in condition to take water. At 3 PM the pump being ready, the flood gates in the forward water tight bulkhead were opened and a flow of water permitted. The limbers under the coal bunkers seemed to be frozen, or choked in some other way for but little water would pass through. Such as did came through was pumped out through the fire hose on the spar deck to the outside floe. As the steam pump suction was on the port side, and the ship had a heel of 2.5  to Stbd. the steam pump would take water only when it flowed over the main Kelson; and sufficient water to do this came aft only once or twice in the course of an hour. Kept all hands on deck working the pump until midnight when one watch was permitted to go below. Oakum was driven in at every space in the solid 1.27 bow filling through which water came, but as the lower part would be filled, water would come through above, and when finally the after side of the filling was stuffed so full of oakum and tallow that but a little water dipped through, the water was forced out through the ceiling. Seeming to come up from the space between the planking and ceiling. Men were engaged in digging away the ice under the bow to get at the injury if possible, but upon removing the piled up floe pieces, water flowed and froze over the main floe to such a depth as prevented continuance of the work. Until the injury can be seen and determined, nothing more than an opinion can be expressed on to its nature. But from the steady flow of water, its locality, and in view of the great pressure experienced, it may be taken for granted that the fore foot is broken and bent aside springing off the garboard strakes with it. Sufficient pressures have been exerted under and against the stem to lift the ship 2 inches forward.  Early daylight at 6.50 AM. No soundings taken at noon. Considerable ice movement from time to time during the day, and an almost continuous heavy pressure against the ship on all sides.

Date: 20/01/1880
As the limber holes under the coal bunkers remained frozen or otherwise choked to such an extend as to prevent the ready flow of water aft to the steam pump, it was decided at the beginning of these twenty four hours to remove an auxiliary steam pump from the engine room to the old galley room, over the chain lockers, and by running a line of piping from the main boiler to it, and attaching a suction pipe leading into the flour room, pump out sufficient water to enable us to build a bulkhead across the fore peak which would control the flow of water to such an extent as to permit the occasional using of the bilge pump keeping the ship free. Work was immediately commenced on this auxiliary pump, and it was placed in the old galley room, and necessary repairs were made to it. After it was in place an attempt  was made to run it by the Baxter Boiler, but it was found that the pump was too large for the capacity of the boiler, exhausting it almost immediately, and the plan was abandoned. Engineer force was then employed to fit and run the line of steam piping to get steam from the main boiler through the steam whistle pipe. The work is not complete at midnight. While this work was going on the remainder of the crew were kept at work by watches in pumping the water out by the forward bilge pump on deck, being able to keep the water under control, and even occasionally getting the water down to 12 inches. Such water as flowed aft to the Engine Room was at once pumped out by the steam pump there, and towards the close of the day the flow was freer, enabling us to use the steam pump in Engine Room for 15 minutes in every half hour. All the sea cocks being frozen fast in their Seats the boiler is blown as occasion requires into the bilge, and is fed from the bilge. Broke out the Starboard chain locker, and moved a lot of provisions aft on Quarter-Deck. Discontinued using Baxter Boiler to distill water, being able to distill below in the Engine Room, and requiring all the pipe connections of the Baxter Boiler to lead Steam from Steam whistle pipe to auxiliary pump forward.
Considerable ice movement and pressure during the day. The ship is heeled 3 to Starboard and the floe in which She is embedded has swung one and a quarter points in azimuth. Light breezes from between S + W all day with slowly falling barometer and slightly rising temperature. The movement of the ice seems to be to the E'd. Then are numerous ridges in sight where the floes have been broken and piled up upon coming in contact. The floe around the ship remains the same as yesterday but when  pressed yields in heavy surges which causes the ship to crack and scrape. A careful examination shows no signs of anything having given away below, and every reason for the opinion of yesterday that the fore foot has been sprung off starting the garboard strakes.

Early daylight at 6.47am. The sky at the begining of the day was nearly clear of clouds with Auroral bands and broken arches curving away from NxE to NW chiefly in NW. Also streamers in NxE. Late in the am the aurora passed to S as a pale arcg having an altitude of 25o, with streamers radiating from NE to NW at intervals.
By 1 am the work of running steam piping to the auxiliary pump forward from the main boiler by way of the whistle pipe was completed and an attempt was made to send steam through it, but the steam whistle pipe being frozen none would pass. Took down and thawed pipe and tried again getting the pump to work. Found the suction pipe too small, and substituted the main engine bilge suction pipe for it. This was completed at 7 am and the auxiliary steam pump set to work performing well, keeping the water in check. As the water flowed more freely to the Engine room pump that was run about half the time also; and the fore peak was thus kept free enough to build a small bulkhead resting on the cant frames fast abaft the bow filling constructed at Mare Island and checking the flow of water in that places. As at times the suction pipe of the auxiliary pump got the water down to the sucking point, plugs were driven in the forward bulkhead of the fore hold to keep the water from flowing aft to the engine room to proceed to make the necessary forgings and fittings for connecting the forward spar deck hand bilge pump to the Baxter Boiler 2 FP Engine.

it was found that a solid floe piece had shoved under the Fire Hole at a depth of four feet
As the water was becoming low enough to work beneficially in the fore peak commenced cutting and fitting planking for the erection of a water tight bulkhead across the fore peak 1 1/3 feet forward of the foremast, but holes in the ceiling above berth deck on each side and packed down in the spaces between frames as much ashes picked felt as they would take. Water seeing good effect towards the close of the day. The steam auxiliary pump was kept going almost continuously. Found a break in the suction pipe and repaired it. Added two lengths of pipe to it so as have a piece of suction pipe laying horizontally in the bilge, and we found the pump to draw more water than before. Up to noon the steam pump in Engine Room was run about half the time. Sufficient thawing or other clearing in the limbers under coal bunkers having taken place to permit the water accumulating there to flow aft. After noon only sufficient water came aft to after pump to supply the boiler and blow it. In addition to tending the boiler and steam pumps the Engineer Force was employed in making forgings for the prepared connections to Baxter Engine, and in making a boring bar and band and a pulley to fit the shaft of the Edison Electric Dynamic Machine to be used on a counter shaft to run the hand Bilge pump when the connections are made to the Baxter Engine.  Upon attempting to resume the daily soundings it was found that a solid floe piece had shoved under the Fire hold at a depth of four feet, completely closing it from below so that no lead could be got through. This would be a proof that the floe, while in its advance had caused so much longitudinal pressure and strain on the ship, had passed under the floe in which the ship is embedded, breaking perhaps the fore foot in passing.

Upon attempting to resume the daily soundings it was found that a solid floe piece had shoved under the Fire Hold at a depth of four feet, completely closing it from below So that no lead could be got through. This would be a proof that the floe, which in its advance had caused so much longitudinal pressure and stress on the ship, had passed under the floe in which the ship is embedded, breaking perhaps the fore foot in passing.

Early daylight at 7.40am. Very rosy flush to Sd at noon very strongly marking Suns position.
The auxiliary pump is kept going all the time, and the steam pump in the Engine Room is working about one half the time. Work progressing on the bulkhead across the fore peak and at midnight all but one upright plank is in place. Left this one plank and in order to secure a passage way while stringers and braces are bolted in place abaft the bulkhead to enable it to withstand pressure. Early in the morning shoved down plaster of paris in the spaces between frames forward of the bulkhead, hoping that the action of the water on it will turn it into a kind of cement. Also poured in ashes and picked felt. The construction of the gearing for connecting hand bilge pump with Baxter Boiler and Engine is completed, but cannot be used until the completion of the bulkhead and the successful choking of the spaces between frames make it possible to keep the ship by the deck bilge pump alone.  A careful calculation of the performance of the auxiliary steam pump and the main steam pump gives the following result: Amount of water pumped by Auxiliary pump her hour= 1608 galls. Running one half time "   "   "   "   "  Main "  " = 2055 " As we hold the water in check the leak per hour   = 3663 "  The depth of water in the ship to day is as follows:                 At 8 Am             At 4 Pm           At Midnight At step of foremast                                                               21 1/2 inches   19 1/2 inches  19 inches At auxiliary pump suction.

The Auxiliary pump is kept going all the time and the Engine Room pump about one half the time, keeping the water in check and occasionally gaining a little on it. Finished the construction of the bulkhead by midnight, ready for caulking. The conders and ashes, and plaster of paris not seeming to get down sufficiently low to check up all spaces between frames it is decided to cut away the ceiling above and below the bilge stralles to give easier access to the spaces. Work progresses slowly beacuase of our having but two men able to properly handle tools and fit material. Cut through the floe in two places to get soundings but at a depth of four feet came to another floe which has shoved under it. Water flowing up prevents cutting through the second floe.

At 2 and 3 am and at 2, 3, 5, 8, 9 and 11 PM the ice was in motion near the ship to the S'd x W'd, communicating pressure to the floe by which the ship is Surrounded and nipping the vessel at times Severely. No change in the amount of leak is observed as a result of these nips, the Strain Seeming to be exerted on the quarters. The work of stuffing oakum, plaster of paris etc in the spaces between frames, and in spaces between frames and ceiling has been successful to the extent of materially diminishing the amount of water flowing into the ship. The limber holes having become materially thawed out, the incoming water flowed aft so freely to the Sewell pump in the Engine Room that at the beginning of this day the auxiliary pump forward ceased to take water and was stopped. By Keeping the Sewell pump going all the time the Ship was kept free to the extent of holding the water in check.

The rig for connecting the Steam Cutters engine to the bilge pump of the main engines being completed. Steam was led to it from the main boiler to tug it. The trial was not satisfactory. The following seemed to be the difficulty: The pump is a 6 inch force pump forcing water through a 1 1/2 inch pipe which in its course to the outside of the Ship is long and sinuous. The Steam Cutters engine is a 4 1/2" x 6" engine, and rigged to work the pump by two pulleys on the shafting which by crank motion and belting works the pump. The speeds are as 3 to 1. After laboring 4 hours to overcome the difficulty, the discharge pipe in the Ships side was found to be frozen solid. While thawing it preparatory to another effort these 24 hours close.

The Sewell pump in the Engine Room is kept running about 15 minutes every hour to pump out such amounts of water as flow aft through leaky gate of water tight bulkhead forward. Fire is kept under Baxter Boiler to heat Deckhouse and as the water accumulated forward of the water tight bulkhead to pump it out by the forward spar deck bilge pump.  Engineer's force continue converting 6 inch piston pump into 3 inch plunger pump and necessary work for fitting Steam Cutters boiler to run the Steam Cutters engine in connection with said pump.  Having broken out the provisions and other stores it was found that an accumulation of dirt and rust prevented the long rod (working from spar deck to close the gate) from working properly on the screw spindle connected with the Stbd. gate. Having cleared it, the gate was closed as far as possible, but enough water forced its way through to necessitate the working of the Sewell pump as above stated. The port gate seemed perfectly tight. To reach the difficulty at the Starboard gate it will be necessary  to cut away the flooring in the small store room between fore hold and coal bunkers, while work will be immediately commenced. The gate is either sprung out of place or broken.

At 11 three fan-like Streamers diverging in WNW and Converging in NE with altitudes respectively of 45, 60 and 75. At midnight the auroral display was magnificent. The three fan-like Streamers mentioned at 11 continued at the same altitudes (45, 60 and 75 in N) but at the NE ending the three Streamers united to form a thick Spiral band of light twirling around on its point. Masses of green light passed over the middle Streamer (or arch), and, regularly following the Spiral disappeared at the horizon. Suddenly the eastern spiral-like ending expanded into a spiral-like curtain, and all three arches rose and advanced until the Central one reached the zenith. Now a pause of two minutes duration occurred, both ends becoming spiral curtains and bearing E.S.E. and W.N.W. respectively. Pulsations of green light ~ pulsations of red light through all three arches, and finally the central arch assumed the colors and regularity of a rainbow, while red and green prevailed Successively in the Northern and Southern arches, making them wiggle like Serpents. The ship and floe were lighted up as if by a full moon. At the end of the two minutes the arches swung on the zenith as on a pivot until they faced W.S.W. and then they moved downward toward that horizon in the same manner and with the same succession changes as in moving upward, until reaching 45, 60 and 75 in alt. respectively, they died away.

Although unable to find any leak through the water tight bulkhead, the carpenters have been   employed in touching up the doubtful places in it. The Baxter Boiler requiring blowing early this AM.   the working of the forward spar deck bilge pump was stopped for about an hour. During this time the   water rose to a height of 30 inches forward of the water tight bulkhead, and the sound of water   flowing freely aft between planking and frames could be heard. As a consequence the water rose to a   greater height in the fire room bilge. Upon resuming work with the Baxter rig the height of the water   forward of water tight bulkhead was speedily reduced to 22 inches, when the rapid flow of water aft   ceased, only the usual half inch per hour finding its way into the Engine Room.   The Steam Cutters boiler being in readiness Steam was got in it to work the Steam Cutters engine in   connection with the converted bilge pump of the main engine. The combination worked well, pumping   out the Engine room dry. It was found however that the Cutters boiler was too small to supply steam   constantly, the steam running down too low while blowing the boiler or cleaning the fire to keep the   pump going steadily. In order to get the greatest effective power of this rig before hauling the fire under   the main boiler, the Engineers force commence removing the bridge wall in the furnace of Cutters   boiler, and making a new bridge wall, putting in a 16 inch grate bar instead of a 9 inch grate bar and   thus increase the grate surface from 144 square inches to 256 square inches.

Completed the work of removing the bridge wall of steam cutters furnace and placing 16 inch grate   bars instead of 9 inch grate bars. Got steam on cutters boiler again and found upon lengthened trial   that the alteration before mentioned made it possible to work continuously the rig to main engine bilge   pump, and thus keep the bilge nearly dry. Hauled the fires under the main boiler, run all the water from   it, and drained out all engine and boiler pipes to prevent their freezing, and pumped the bilge dry with   Steam Cutter rig.

Crew digging away the ice under the bows. Land was sighted bearing South (magnetic) in two high mountains with a saddle between them. A bear was shot by Alexey about 7 miles to the Westward of the Ship, and buried in the snow after skinning, it being too late to get the body to the ship before night.
At 4 am sound from ice in motion to NE and E following occasional slight jars to ship at 3 am. 
At 1 am faint aurora chiefly in NE and W.N.W. Lunar circle. At 2 a.m. very faint auroral patches. At 3 faint auroral glimmers in W.N.W. The Sun was raised by refraction above the horizon before 6 a.m. At 11 Pm broken curtain arches 10 and 20 in altitude to N.E. extending from E to N. An exceptionally beautiful auroral display commenced shortly before midnight. From W x S to N.E. and chiefly South of zenith, from 10 to 15 in alt. an auroral band extended in a Series of flat Semi-elliptical curves opening to the Nd. On the inner or North edge of the band it was brilliantly white, while the light faded down toward the Southern horizon to a pale cloud-like intensity, in which faint lines would occasionally show. To the North of zenith very meagre bands of long streamers hung across the Sky. A peculiarity of the display was the regularity with which the curves, which were moving slowly along the band from W to E broke into rapid and distorting undulations when they aimed at a point lying within the space apparently occupied by the Constellation Ursa Major. There the E. end of the curve would suddenly deepen and double back sharply, while the aurora would be violently agitated and would show the prismatic colors with extraordinary vividness. Occasionally the organization of the original curve would be maintained notwithstanding the extraordinary rapidity of the movements around its margin, but usually the curve was broken or seemed to collapse, to be succeeded by forms, in the zenith of indescribable outline because of the rapidity of changes. At times it seemed as if there were two distinct strata of aurora, the lower one being most agitated. So that the prismatic colors in modified tints crossed and recrossed each other while the whole looked like a magnificent pyrotechnic display on which various colored and intense lights were thrown. In the West the band showed occasionally that at great distance in that direction a similar movement  was in progress, while to the Ed such a movement was plainly discernible the rapid changes of the foldings in the band taking the forms of spiral curtains. The whole display after lasting a half hour moved to N. of zenith fading as it went.

Having finished all connections of the Baxter Boiler and Engine to the bilge pump shifted from forward to the corner of the fire room halets, it was set in operation. It was found that the combination was capable of pumping out all the water that comes into the ship at present, the flood gates in the water tight bulkhead being opened to permit the water to come aft freely. But owing to the severity of the temperature, (the discharging being done through a canvas hose led across the spar deck from the fire room halets to a scupper) ice would form during the intervals when the pump was at rest and stop proceedings.

It was found that the combination was capable of pumping out all the water that comes into the Ship at present, the flood gates in the water tight bulkhead being opened to permit the water to come aft freely. But owing to the Severity of the temperatures, (the discharging being done through a canvas have led across the spar deck from the fire room hatch to a scupper) ice would form during the intervals when the pump was at rest, and stop proceedings. The flood gates were again closed, the use of the new pump rig postponed to more reasonable temperature, and the work of pumping resumed by the Steam Cutters engine aft, and by hand at the Starboard bilge pump forward as required. The Steam Cutters boiler is also used for distilling.

The ice varies in thickness from four to twenty feet, with small holes here and there through the thinner ice. The Ship is heeled 6 to Starboard and the water level is to day at 7 feet 2 inches forward and 12 feet 4 inches aft. The ice forward probably extends down to her keel, being the formation caused by under riding floes on January 19th. From the mainmast aft She is held by ice about 5 feet in thickness the Surface of which is from one to two feet under water. The amount of water now coming into the Ship from the damaged Garboards ( as supposed) is pumped out by about 300 strokes of the hand bilge pump per day.

Water Temperature and Specific Gravity / The depth of water not being great, but t an Cosella Miller Thermometer was used which was attached to the lead line about one fathom above the lead. The Number of the Thermometer used is written in Red Ink abreast of the Sounding. They were found upon comparison to agree with Standard Mercurial Number 4313. / Temperatures at a depth of two fathoms below the surface were obtained by allowing the water to enter the ship through one of the sea cocks in her bottom, (which sea cock was quite uniformly 12 feet below the surface) and after a short time, say a minute or two, filling a hydrometer cup with compared Thermometer attached, and reading the height of the mercury therein. / Temperatures of Surface water were obtained by immersing a compared Thermometer in the Fire Hole alongside the ship.
Water was brought up from near the bottom by a 'Sigsher Water Cup" attached to the lead line. Water from 2 fathoms below the surface and from the surface, was obtained from the Sea Cock and Fire Hole as mentioned above. / Specific Gravities were obtained from readings of a Hydrometer marked Taglialme New York. Specific Gravity 60 degrees Fahr. of a scale ranging from 1.020 to 1.030, where the water was of a desnity within the scale. Otherwise the readings were of a more delicate Hydrometer marked "Reinmann & Baetz, 96 Fallow St. NY Specific Gravity 60 degrees F. Scale 1000 to 1040."

It was not considered advisable to change the date for ships purposes in crossing the 180th Meridian of Longitude; and therefore the old date was carried forward from day to day and the proper local date written under in Red Ink.

The pumping is done by hand at the Quarter-deck bilge pump. It is found that 1295 Strokes of the bilge pump are now necessary each day to keep the Ship free of water, whereas heretofore (and subsequent to July 15th) 240 strokes per ~ were all that was required.  The ship is heeled 7 to Starboard, and the water line is at 7 feet 0  inches forward and 13 feet 1  inches aft, and the increase of the amount of water coming into the Ship is probably due to the melting of the ice at and around the injury to the Stem.

sawing through ice varying in thickness from 4 1/2 feet to 8 1/2 feet
no drift indicated by the lead line.
Crew engaged during the day in sawing throught the ice surrounding the stern in order to get up and examine the propeller. After sawing through ice varying in thickness from 4 1/2 feet to 8 1/2 feet, making a cut on each side, forward of the mizen mast, extending out from the ships side, the floe suddenly broke in two pieces at about 2.30 PM and floating to the surface was dragged clear of the ship. This ice had been clinging to the ship and was about 2 feet under the surface of the water while being sawed.
The ship is firmly held by ice which extends from the main rigging on the port side around the bows and to the after part of the fore rigging on the starboard side, and which when possible to measure is found to have a thickness of 10 feet 11 inches. It probably extends under her keel froming a cradle: and though it would perhaps be possible to haul the ship astern into a small pool of clear water it is not attempted for fear of increasing the facility into which water might enter through the damaged stern and so require additional labor or even steam pumping to keep the ship free. Without a single lead of water in any direction accessible to the ship, her being navigated is impossible, and there would be nothing gained by her being floated inot a a small lake.

Crew engaged during the day in sawing through the ice surrounding the Stem in order to get up and examine the propeller. After sawing through ice varying in thickness from 4  feet to 8  feet, making a cut on each side, forward of the mizzen mast, extending out from the Ships side, the floe suddenly broke in two pieces at about 2.30 P.M. and floating to the Surface was dragged clear of the Ship. This ice had been clinging to the Ship and was about 2 feet under the Surface of the water while being sawed.  The Ship immediately went down in the water aft 7 inches and came up forward  inch; the water level being now at a height of 7 feet 2 inches on the Stem, and 13 feet 9  inches on the rudder post. The heel is now 8  to Starboard having been increased only 1/4  by the change of immersion. The Ship is yet firmly held by ice which extends from the main rigging on the port side around the bows and to the after part of the fore-rigging on the Starboard side, and which where possible to measure is found to have a thickness of 10 feet 11 inches. It probably extends under her keel forming a cradle; and though it would perhaps be possible to haul the Ship astern into a small pool of clear water it is not attempted for fear of increasing the facility with which water might enter through the damaged Stem and so required additional labor or even steam pumping to keep the Ship, her being navigated is impossible, and there would be nothing gained by her being floated into a small lake.  Hoisted screw and found it in perfect order, the blades being neither bent North twisted in all our encounters with the ice. From some causes, (perhaps the formation and lodgment of ice in the sleeve of the deadwood) the Shaft could be revolved only a quarter of a turn; this will be overhauled by the Engineers force. Lowered the Screw again to its place.

Crew engaged during the day in sawing up into convenient blocks and removing the ice which was cut away yesterday from around the Stem. Engineers force engaged in seeking the cause for not being able to revolve the screw shaft yesterday. Uncoupled the Engine from the line Shaft and found that the engine moved readily by means of the Jacking-Screw. Coupled the engine and removed the packing from the Stuffing box of the Stem bearing until the water ran freely through the box. Tried to jack the engine and Shaft coupled together but without much effect. The difficulty seemed to be in the Stem pipe or sleeve as there was noise as of grinding in the pipe, and supposing it to be occasioned by ice, the Stuffing box was so arranged as to admit during the night a small Steady Stream of water to aid in thawing.  At 1.30 P.M. a bear coming near to the Ship on her port side was seen by the dogs and chased into a small pool when he was held at bay until killed by Mr. Nindemann. At 2.30 a bear and two cubs were seen approaching the Starboard quarter, crossing leads and ice until about 300 yards from the Ship, when they seemed disposed to retreat. A volley was then fired at them wounding the bear and one cub, as could be determined by the trails of blood. Though immediately chased by officers, men and dogs,  and the Second Cub wounded, all three bears managed to escape by swimming across leads, (which for men required long detours,) and thus getting out of range.

At 9.25 AM the ship suddenly righted to an even keel and moved astern about  two feet, settling until the water level was 8 feet 4 inches at the stern and at 13 feet 5 3/4 inches at the rudder-post. The stern being 16 inches clear of the groove in the floe against witch it had been resting, it was supposed that the ship was afloat fore and aft. And an ice claw was carried out astern to the ice, and by an attached hawser it was attempted to haul the ship astern clear of the large masses of ice surrounding her bow. After parting one hawser and only turning the ship one point - in azimuths without moving her otherwise, it was found that she was still held by the ice under her keel forward a measuring rod striking hard ice at a depth of 7 feet 4 inches below the water level. A second and larger hawser was then got out and hove on with the capstan without effect. An ice saw was then employed to saw through a large piece of ice against the starboard bow, (and presumably extending below and under the keel) of a thickness of 11 feet.
After sawing through 5 or 6 feet, the leak (which had been carefully watched from the first movement of the ship) was found to increase and all sawing and attempts to drag the ship astern were at once discontinued. The gate in the extra buckhead in the fore peak had been closed promptly at 9.35 AM and the increase of water made its way aft among the frames between ceiling and planking and under flooring of the fore peak. The leak now requires 3200 strokes of the hand bilge pump per 24 hours against 1295 strokes on the 11 August. At 8 PM the ship was on nearly an even keel with the water level at 8 feet 10 3/4 inches on the stern and 13 feet 4 1/2 inches on the rudder post.

Aurora
no drift indicated by lead line.
At midnight one half of the Sky was covered by cumulu-stratus clouds moving from N, to S. and at that moment extending from the zenith to the Southern horizon obscuring the moon and the Stars. (North of the zenith the Sky was clear, except a streak of cirro-stratus above a small bank of rising cumulu-stratus)  Immediately following the cumulu-stratus clouds and near the zenith was a faint Auroral arch extending from East to West, with its ends slightly curving to the Southward and hidden by the clouds near the horizon. As the clouds nearly uncovered the East end, a mass of bright green light shot up, and spread like a fan over 10 of arc; and just as the east end was completely uncovered the mass changed into brilliant green spiral curtains terminating a bright white arch through zenith to West. After perhaps a minute, the clouds being well clear of the arch to the light paled and lost colors, and the arch-ends straggled back to N.W. and N.E., the center being at the zenith. The moon then became entirely uncovered, the floe seemed lighted as in mid day, and but few faint streaks of arches remained, then and almost indeterminate.

At 3 A.M. a very remarkable auroral display was observed as follows: - a bright auroral curtain about 10 above the horizon from E.N.E. to N.W., generally white but occasionally showing a green shade, and rarely a brownish-red color, which disappeared as soon as seen. above this curtain the sky was of a deep blue black color, through which the stars shone brilliantly as they also did through the deepest part of the curtain. Above the deep blue black color there were irregular spirals and streaks of white light which were in continuous motion, appearing and disappearing rapidly. From E. to W. through zenith was an irregular arch formed of detached streaks of brownish-red light, among which white light would suddenly appear and as suddenly vanish. This arch was about 5 broad. Stars shone with apparently undiminished brilliancy through the deepest color. Between this arch and a bank of Stratus clouds above the Southern horizon, the Sky was covered with irregular patches and streaks of light which seemed to drift away to windward (S.W.).  At 3.30 all had broken up and drifted to S.W., and there succeeded white flashes all over the Sky. At 6 A.M. faint arch from E. to W. through zenith; at 9 A.M. faint arch from E.N.E. to N.N.W. alt of 20. Low faint dawn. at 6 P.M. faint arch 5 in alt N.W. to E. at 9 P.M. double curtain 10 in alt from N.W. to E.; and at midnight irregular curtains 40 and 50 in alt from N.W. to E.

Aurora
At 3 A.M. an auroral arch from S.E. to S.W. 10 in altitude, and also broken curtain and irregular streaks and patches from W.N.W. around by North to S.E. 10  to 15 in altitude, at 6 A.M. arch from S.E. to S.W. 10 in altitude, with streaks and patches in E. and W. direction from arch to zenith.  About 9 P.M. there was a remarkable auroral display which is described by Lieut. Chipp as follows:- at about 8.50 P.M. there were 3 auroral curtains extending in arches from a mass of green and yellow light near the N.W. horizon to near the East horizon. The upper arch was about 60 and the others about 45 and 30 respectively. The highest arch was the most brilliant. The general color was a bright yellow. Suddenly a brown-red color flashed across from N.W. to E., and the curtains were violently agitated. Luminous rays formed, darting across the curtains with variable lengths. Meanwhile the curtains undulated violently with short quick waves from N.W. to E., and at the same time would change their altitudes up and down about 5, keeping about the same space apart. The darting of rays and rapid undulations, gave the arches the appearance of torrents of light rushing from N.W. to E. The lower parts of the curtains were cherry red, next green, while the greater part was of a bright yellow. The cherry-red rays from the bases of the curtains flashing in with rays of green and yellow caused many colors to be seen, so that the lower halves of the curtains looked not unlike irregular rainbows violently agitated. During the display the North end of the Galvanometer needles connected in the Cabin was deflected 20 E. (not an unusual amount) having been 10 East at 8 P.M. and again at 9.10 P.M. when the great brilliancy had ceased. Another description, by Lieut DeLong is as follows:-At 9 P.M.  from the N.W. horizon there projected upward a curving column of brilliant green and reddish-pink light in violent movement (resembling the movement but far exceeding the brightness of a flame shooting from a ~ signal light) which, while undergoing twistings and undulations every half second spread out at an altitude of 10 above the horizon into 3 magnificent curtain arches spanning the sky at altitudes of 35 40 and 45 respectively and extending to the Eastern horizon. These arches were in a state of violent agitation, flashing trembling and pulsating every half second while receiving and passing along repeated changes from the supplying column. The upper portion of each curtain was of the usual greenish-white color, the middle portion was of a vivid pale green; and the under portion consisted of an exceedingly delicate pink fringe which trembled and quivered without rest. Numerous bands above and beneath the arch showed the pulsations of colored lights also but to no very marked extent. In about 15 minutes the supply seemed to diminish in the column and the lights to grow faint. The arches and bands then rose , massing at the zenith in an arch 10 in width while some of the pulsations were repeated, but backward, or if returning to their source, and the broad arch separated into several narrower ones. Loops, and coronas, leaving the sky in a state of general illumination.

Aurora
a very rapid drift to ExN being indicted by the lead line.
At 3 A.M. a very beautiful aurora was visible, and is thus described by Passed Assistant Surgeon Ambler:- An auroral curtain arch extended from N.W. x W. through the zenith to S.E. x E. It was composed of striae of great brilliancy, while between them were masses of luminous nebulae not so intense in brightness. The lower edge of the whole arch was frequently interrupted in its regular form, as if made up of rays of greater intensity and longer axes than the luminous nebulae before referred to. Pulsations of the most brilliant purple, green and white colors went from one end to the other. As I looked, the arch flashed into a Corona. The rays ascended, forming as they lengthened, a hollow cane into the inside of which I could see. The most rapid change of color took place up and down the side of the cane (the colors being more beautiful than I ever saw them) and most brilliant at the apex.  The angle of inclination of the Striae corresponded seemingly with the angle of the dipping-needle. At 9 P.M. three irregular auroral bands from S.E. to N.W. 20, 30 and 40 respectively above the Southern horizon; and at midnight a bright curtain arch, 15 above Northern horizon, from N.W. to N.E., and a faint curtain arch 15 above Southern horizon from S.W. to S.E.

Sunrise 8h 22m  Sunset not visible on account of cloudiness  At 3 A.M. bright curtain arch from E. to W. through zenith. At 9 P.M. an arch from N.W. to S.E. 75 above Northern horizon, broken into small sections by stratus and nimbus clouds into it. Curtain patches visible between N. horizon and 50 in altitude. The arch slowly faded leaving a general mass of light alternating apparently with clouds in covering the whole sky. At 10 P.M. the sky was covered by Nimbus clouds except in a space between N.W. and North when there was a bright spot extending from the horizon to an altitude of 10 at its highest part and somewhat of this shape.         The clouds terminating in a sharply defined horizontal line. From and two degrees below this line, auroral light of a bright green color lay in a band with a fine streak at each extremity making the curved lines of the cloud form as indicated above. Suddenly the band changed into a beautiful vertically-striated curtain with pink frings which swayed and trembled with rapid flashes, and brightened and paled as pulsations crossed from right to left. There seem to be some great electric disturbance going on behind the clouds, of which disturbance but one edge could be seen; far, soon after fainter lights could be seen through the cloud to the S.E., and the clouds overhead opened somewhat showing a general background of green light. The fringed curtain had by this time subsided into a quiet mass of green light.

At Midnight a curtain arch from E.S.E. to West 45 above Southern horizon composed of the most brilliant striae: flashing, trembling, dancing up and down, breaking into segments, appearing for a moment as two arches advancing toward zenith and then receding, turning into spirals, and generally in a state of violent agitation. The prevailing colors seemed to be a pale green, and the fringe a bright-pink. The pulsations of light and movement from the E.S.E. In 15 minutes it quieted down leaving the sky nearly covered by bands and patches without movement.

At 7 PM land was sighted from aloft by Mr William Dunbar, Ice Pilot and bearing S78 45 W (magnetic) or N 83 15 W true. It appears to be an Island and such part of it as is visible is of this shape [sketch]
but aring to fog hanging partly over it and partly to the Northward of it no certainty is felt that this is all of it. It is also visible from the deck, but no estimate can be made of its distance.
As no such land is laid down upon any charts in our possession, belief that we have made a discovery is permissable.
This is the first land of any kind seen by this ship since March 24th 1880, at which date we saw for the last time the north side of "Wrangel's Land"

The land sighted yesterday remains visible all day but with greater clearness and distinctness. We are now able to determine its shape with greater exactness, and it is as below roughly sketched.
The clouds of yesterday or fog bank as then called, have disappeared from the upper part of the island. We are able to see apparent rocky cliffs with a snow covered slope extrending back to the Westward from them, and terminating in a conical mass like a volcano top.

Crew engaged in digging down through the ice on the port side of the Stern in an effort to reach the fore-foot. The ice was first bored to a depth of 10 feet 2 inches without getting to the bottom of it: next a hole was dug 4 feet in depth, and from the bottom of this hole a boring was made to a depth of 10 feet 2 inches, still not reaching the bottom of the ice at 14 feet 2 inches: But water now came oozing in to fill up the space dug and further effort was not made. It is fair to assume that the thickness is more than one floe, and that the water flows in between the blocks as they lie one above the other.
An opening occurred in the ice about 500 yards to the Eastward of the ship, and partially closed at 10 pm. the ship receiving several slight shocks as the edges of the ice came together.
The island remains in plain view all day, and at times after 6 pm a very strong appearance of higher land beyond and to the Westward is seen seemingly connected by a snowy slope into what we have called an island.

At 9.30 AM the ice opened 70 yards from the Stbd bow, leaving a lane of water about 20 feet in width and extending in a North and South direction a about 3 miles. At the same time several other openings could be seen from aloft towards the NW.
The island remains in plain view all day, though nothing can be seen of the high land beyond, the strange appearance of which is noted in yesterdays log -  The centre of the island near beam West true but as no observations could be attained to day its position and distance can not be determined by the change of bearing.

The point of the Island which on the 16th inst. bore N83 15 W (true) to day bears S78 30 W (true) from which change of bearing it is computed that the Island is now 24 3/5 Miles distant. The position of the observed point is therefore Lat 76 47 28 N Long 159 20 45 E.

The engineers force are occupied in putting the Wind Mill pumping gear into working order.
John Lauterback (Coal Heaver) - sustained a severe sprain in the back by reason of accident in the transporting of a Skin boat over the ice. He was one of a party of men engaged in this work and while carrying the boat on their shoulders it slipped and brought too much weight on this single man.
At 8 AM the ice was found to have opened in numerous long lanes, some connected and some single extending generally in the NNW and SSE direction. By making occasional portages boats were able to go several miles from the vessel, but for the ship herself there were no ice openings of sufficient magnitude.
The strange appearance of land mentioned on the 18th inst. proves to day to have been land in fact and for reasons similar to those herein ste forth (in the remarks of the 16th inst) it may be recorded as another discovery. This second land is an island, of withc the postion and present distance are yet to be ascertained. The following barings were taken.  Ships Head  = S 14W true; Eastern end of island first seen on 16th inst. = S 17 W true; Nearest end (southern T) isalnd seen to day = S 69 30 W true; 
The following sextant angles were taken from the Crows Nest. Isalnd first seen subtends an angle of 0 degrees 16'\ Island seen to day subtends an angle of 3 degrees 35'; Island first seen has an altitude of 0 egrees 16' / Island seen to day has an altitude of 0 degrees 10'; Interval between two island = 49 degrees 55' -

From the domed and cracked appearance of the ice around the stern it would seem that the ship is endeavoring to rise from her ice-deck. To facilitate her rising and to relieve the strain upon the Keel under the propeller, the men are engaged forenoon and afternoon in digging away the ice under the counters and in the neighborhood of the propeller well. The said ice is of a flinty hardness and clings so closely to the ship as to show the grain of the wood, and to tear out the oakum visible where the ship's rising has has left open spaces.

At 12.10 AM the ice suddenly opened alongside and the ship righted to an even keel. Called all hands at once and brought in the few remaining things on the ice. The ship settled down to her proper bearings near by the draft forward being 8 ft. 11 in. forward and 12 fet 6 inches aft. A large block of ice could be seen remaining under her keel. At the first alarm the gate in the water tight bulkheads forward was closed but the water coming into the ship was found to decrease - a small stream trickling aft being all that could be seen.
There being many large spaces of water near us and the ice having a generally broken up appearance, it was concluded to ship the rudder to be ready for an emergency awaiting the moving of the ship. After some trouble in removing accumlations of ice around the gudgeon the rudder was shipped and everything cleared away inthe wake of the booms and yard for making sail.
As well as could be judged by looking down through the water under the counters there was no injury whatsoever to the after booy of the ship. As soon as possible a bow line and quarter line had been got out and the ship secured temporarily to the ice which remained on the starboard side as nearly in the same berth as she could be placed. By looking down through the water alongside the stern on the port side, one of the bow straps near the fore foot was seen to be sprung off - but othewise no damage could be detected.
It was assumed by me that the heavy ice which all along bore heavily against the stern had held the plank ends open at the garboards, open, and  that as soon as the ship was able to move from the heavy ice the wood ends came together again closing much of the opening and reducing the lead - The water or rather water level being below the berth deck, no difficulty was anticipated in keeping the ship afloat and navigating her to some port should she ever be liberated from the pack ice of the Arctic Ocean.

a moderate drift to SSW being indicated by the lead line.
Weather generally dull and gloomy. Forward 6 PM it commenced to clear a little but from thence to midnight much fog prevailed. Large ponds of water in sight in all directions and great activity in the ice. Lanes of water opening and closing during the forenoon, and whenever edges of ice fields come together large ridges and confused heaps of floe peices are thrown up. The ship and her surrounding floe are drifting to the S'd and W'd. and sometimes due West, and are going to pass across the North face of Henrietta Island. The floe surrounding the ship (and it is an irregular island whose greatest diameter is about 1 Mile land least diameter about 1/2 mile) seems to be the firmest ice in the neighborhood of the Island; but beyond our floe there is nothing but a chaotic mass of rubble ice, grinding and crashing and piling up wherever it meets resistance, and settling down and spreading apart when the impeding obstacle is remove - This seemingly, continues from the edge of our surrounding floe to the shores and cliffs of Henrietta Island and is no doubt occassioned by the passage of the ice fields across the North face of that Island. There are no connected lanes or ponds giving an egress in any direction.
In anticipation of our floe breaking up and our being launched into the confusion reigning aobut us, hoisted the steam-Cutter, brought aboard the Kayaks and Oomiak, and removed from the ice such of our belongings as could not be sucured at a few moments notice.

a moderate drift to WSW being indicated by the lead line.
So thick was the fog until 10 AM that our position with reference to Henrietta Island could not be dtermined. but at that hour the fog cleared away and the isalnd was sighted right ahead and at a distance of about 4 miles. As indicated yesterday we were being drifted across the north face. 
All of the large openings near us have closed: and the general appearance of the ice to the West and NW is that of an immense field broken up in many places by the large piles of broken floe pieces, but with no water spaces -
Considerable water sky is visible to the S and SW and several unconnected lanes of water are to be seen in those directions. The ice having passed the obstruction caused by Henriette Island has closed up again and resumed its accustomed drift to the NW.
