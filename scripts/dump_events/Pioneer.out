A serious accident occurred on board.  The chief engineer and H.B.

Both men were badly hurt, the Chief Engineer was burned in the feet and legs and slightly on the arms, and was cut on the side of the head, and was almost stunned.

Fresh water had flooded for-hold bilges and stood six inches above floor boards in forward hold. Nothing was damaged. The water was pumped out and an investigation disclosed the fact that when fresh water was pumped from fore peak tank the valve to the fore hold bilges in the feed water line, though thought to be closed, was still partially open, resulting in the flooding of the bilges and forward hold. This was not discovered until the hold was opened to stow away lines.

Nte: When the anchor was housed (7:18 A.M) the carpenter turned the steam valve to what he thought was the neutral position and the winch stopped.  Then he started to put on the brake and while doing so the winch started up again and in so doing put such a strain on the winch that it broke the locking ring and driving head. Repairs to the driving head can be made on board but it will be necessary to have the locking ring welded ashore.

Earl Forsberg - sea, a.b. lost overboard. Foot slipped while washing paintwork on outboard side of port motorsailer canopy. Launch had handrope on canopy and there was a safety line passed behind the man and his companion but when he slipped he was not holding on and slid from under the safety line. He wore rubber boats and these evidently carried him down quickly. His companion gave the alarm and the ship was immediately stopped, a life ring having been dropped over first, and a boat was lowered in less than seven minutes. The man was seen by the boat crew just as they took the water but they started for him he sunk and was never seen again. The ship cruised in circles around the buoy, which was found, untill dark but no sign of the man was found. Signed Roland D Horne Exec Off

Cahokia - U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Cahokia came into berth ahead of Pioneer and made fast to the dock. In making her berth, she veered too close to the Pioneer, & carried away the port log boom. On inspection by myself & the oficer of the Cahokia, the damage was found to be nominal & required the replacing of the hinge to the strut & several screws - no other damage was done.

Note: The fathometer appeared to be working poorly so the Submarine Signal Coy representative of San Francisco, Mr Richards, inspected it at the Commanding Officer's request and found that the armature on the generator end of the sonic motor generator was running too hot and throwing out the solder from between the laminat~. On discovering this orders for steam were cancelled and a request to the Navy Yard for inspection & repairs was made.

Report of fire in Radio Shack: (Reported by R. A Gilmore, Acting Officer Deck): At 3.50a.m. June 9 1929 fire was discovered in the radio shack by the Quartermaster on watch, who sounded the alarm and immediately called me.  The fire was confined to a battery closet in the shack and was immediately gotten under control by the use of a hand extinguisher; care being taken not to spray the chemical on the radio apparatus. The fire was declared out at 4.15a.m. and the Q.M. was told to keep a lookout on the shack in case of further trouble. The damage was slight consiting chiefly of a few chemical soaked 'B' batteries and burnt cable insulations.  The closet partitions were badly charred and were removed. The fire was evidently caused by a short circuit.
